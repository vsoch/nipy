<h4>MNE is a software package for processing magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) data.</h4>

<p>The MNE software computes cortically-constrained L2 minimum-norm current estimates and associated dynamic statistical parametric maps from MEG and EEG data, optionally constrained by fMRI.</p>

<p>This software includes MEG and EEG preprocessing tools, interactive and batch-mode modules for the forward and inverse calculations, as well as various data conditioning and data conversion utilities. These tools are provided as compiled C code for the LINUX and Mac OSX operating systems.</p>

<p>MNE-Python implements all the functionality of the MNE Matlab tools in Python and extends the capabilities of the MNE Matlab tools to, e.g., frequency-domain and time-frequency analyses and non-parametric statistics. This component of MNE is presently evolving quickly and thanks to the adopted open development environment user contributions can be easily incorporated.</p>
