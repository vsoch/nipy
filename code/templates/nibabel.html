<h4>Read / write access to some common neuroimaging file formats.</h4>

<p>This package provides read +/- write access to some common medical and neuroimaging file formats, including: ANALYZE (plain, SPM99, SPM2 and later), GIFTI, NIfTI1, NIfTI2, MINC1, MINC2, MGH and ECAT as well as Philips PAR/REC. We can read and write Freesurfer geometry, and read Freesurfer morphometry and annotation files. There is some very limited support for DICOM. NiBabel is the successor of PyNIfTI.</p>

<p>The various image format classes give full or selective access to header (meta) information and access to the image data is made available via NumPy arrays.</p>
